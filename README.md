# Automatic Image Captioning

- Combined CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model that produces captions given an input image.
- Created a deep learning model with two components: a CNN that transforms an input image into a set of features and an RNN that turns those features into rich, descriptive language.
- Implemented deep learning architectures.
